Niantic Cipher Decoder
===============

A basic decipher Python script for the Niantic Project ciphered messages (see http://nianticproject.com/, @nianticproject, etc.) Give it the name of the file and it will extract the shift and decode the message for you.

Reads text from STDIN, pipe it or give it text however you want. Sample usage: `cat cipher5.txt | python funsies.py`
